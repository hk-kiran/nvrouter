This code implements a virtual router in GPU.

The virtual router is designed to handle routing operations using the power of a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). It leverages the parallel processing capabilities of the GPU to perform routing tasks efficiently.

Usage:
- run `make` at the root of the project to generate the binaries in `bin` folder.
- run `./bin/nvrouter` to execute the virtual router.
- run `make clean` at the root of the project to clean intermediate files.
