This code implements a virtual router in GPU.

The virtual router is designed to handle routing operations using the power of a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). It leverages the parallel processing capabilities of the GPU to perform routing tasks efficiently.

Usage:
- Initialize the virtual router with the desired configuration.
- Load the routing table and network topology into the GPU memory.
- Call the appropriate routing functions to perform routing operations.
- Retrieve the routing results from the GPU memory.
